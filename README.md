##Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
*1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
*5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##File overview

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidydata.txt.
